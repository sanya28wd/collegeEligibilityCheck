#In this project, we have made a Graphic User Interface(GUI) for students searching for engineering colleges. Initially, we ask the user to create a login ID so that their selected information remains intact on the website; it takes a username, age and password. After logging in, it feeds additional user information like their board marks, entrance exam scores, and user preferences like budget, state, and ratings. Then we ask the user to choose from the menu if they want a college based on state, ratings, fees, board results or entrance exam results; we have also incorporated a feature that takes in all these as input and returns the ‘best match’.It returns a sorted ArrayList of colleges and their information based on the given criteria. The program is user-friendly and has used the principle of Encapsulation to a greater extent.
